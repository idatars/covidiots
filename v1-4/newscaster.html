            <h3>Using your power:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When you choose to control a player, you get to decide who they target and perform their ability on. Instead of performing their ability on the play they chose, they'll perform it on the one you chose instead.</li>
                <li>If you are infected, your target will get infected. If your target is infected, you will get infected. This does not apply for the target you chose for your victim.</li>
                <li>You cannot control yourself.</li>
                <li>If you are roleblocked by the Telemarketer, your attempt at controlling someone that night will fail!</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tips and other info:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Have fun with your neutral role! Since all you need to do is make it until the end of the game, feel free to side and make deals with either the Covidiots or the townspeople.</li>

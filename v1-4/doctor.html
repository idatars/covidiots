            <h3>Using your power:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If the player you choose to heal is infected, they are now cured and are immune to being infected again. You will not be infected by them.</li>
                <li>If the player you choose to heal is not infected, nothing will happen.</li>
                <li>If you are infected and your target is not, your target does not get infected, but you are still infected.</li>
                <li>You are allowed infinite self-heals.</li>
                <li>If you are roleblocked by the Telemarketer, your attempt at healing someone that night will fail!</li>

            <h3>Tips and other info:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Collaborate with the Tester to be the most effective in healing people! But of course, revealing your identity can lead to you being targeted by the Covidiots.</li>

            <h3>Tips and other info:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Detectives typically lead the deliberation period, especially if they have just investigated a Covidiot. But of course, fully revealing yourself could make you a target for the Covidiots!</li>
                <li>You are allowed to reveal your role during the deliberation period and share any results you have received.</li>

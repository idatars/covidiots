            <h3>Using your power:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>After you infect someone, they are infected for the set amount of days before dying. During this period, anyone that they visit and anyone they are visited will get infected.</li>
                <li>You cannot infect yourself.</li>
                <li>If you are roleblocked by the Telemarketer, your attempt at infecting someone that night will fail!</li>
            </ul>
        </div> 
        <div style="grid-column:4/7">
            <h3>Tips and other info:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>During deliberation, do your best to deflect suspicion! You can try doing this by throwing suspicion or claiming to be a townsperson role.</li>
                <li>Sometimes, townspeople will reveal their roles to try and gain trust from others. You can use this to your advantage by targeting these people, especially if they are a Doctor or Detective. But watch out, they might be the paranoid claiming to be a townsperson!</li>

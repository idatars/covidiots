            <h3>Using your power:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Anyone you roleblock will not be able to perform their ability on the night that you roleblock them.</li>
                <li>If you are infected, your target will get infected. If your target is infected, you will get infected.</li>
                <li>You cannot roleblock yourself.</li>
                <li>If you are roleblocked by the Telemarketer, your attempt at investigating someone that night will fail!</li>

            <h3>Tips and other info:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Roleblocking a Covidiot will prevent them from infecting people, however roleblocking a Doctor will prevent them from healing people. Make your choice wisely!</li>
                <li>Roleblocking the Paranoid will prevent them from killing their visitors (including you :)</li>

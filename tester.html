            <p><b>Goal:</b> To quarantine all Covidiots</p>
            <p><b>Power:</b> Attempts to test one player per night</p>
            <p><b>During the day:</b> Discuss events from the previous night, then vote for players to be quarantined or unquarantined based on how suspicious they are</p>
            <p><b>During the night:</b> Message the Host with the player you would like to test. They will respond with whether that player is infected, not infected, or immune</p>

            <h3>Using your power:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The Host will private message you whether or not your target is infected or immune.</li>
                <li>If you are infected, your target will get infected. If your target is infected, you will get infected. In both cases, your target will come back as 'infected'.</li>
                <li>You are allowed infinite self-tests</li>
                <li>If you are roleblocked by the Telemarketer, your attempt at testing someone that night will fail!</li>

            <h3>Tips and other info:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Collaborate with the Doctor so that they can be as effective as possible in healing people! But of course, revealing your identity can lead to you being targeted by the Covidiots.</li>
                <li>You are allowed to reveal your role during the deliberation period and share any results you have received.</li>
                <li>Self-testing is less effective than testing others; in testing other players, you are effectively also testing yourself (if they test positive, you are also positive). However, this means that there is one more infected player than there would have been if you had just tested yourself.</li>
